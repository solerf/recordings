When wrongly typing `ALT + F keys` a new `tty` will be open, losing where you were, usually the desktop.

Use the `w` command to see where you are:
```shell
user        tty7      lun08   38:57m 21:57  17.21s xfce4-session
user        tty1      11:47   11:09m  0.01s  0.01s -bash
```

Then return with `ALT + F$number`.
